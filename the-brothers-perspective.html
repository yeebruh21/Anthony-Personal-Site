                In September, my brother's cancer came back. As fate would have it, the symptoms began showing just weeks after I left for university. It started with a stomach ache that persisted for unusually long. My parents consulted our family doctor and a few other professionals about the issue, who were all completely dismissive. Even the routine follow-up appointments did not reveal any significant problems. Consequently, more than two months would pass before Aaron received any kind of serious medical attention. The pain finally became impossible to ignore, and my parents forcefully ordered a CT scan. When the results came back, multiple tumours were found in my brother's stomach. The only consolation offered by the clueless family doctor was, 'I am so sorry'. <br><br>

It would be weeks later before I learned of this. I recall being seated in my dorm room, worrying about the impending finals week. A call from my dad disrupted my thoughts, and I picked up expecting another lecture about getting enough sleep or something of the sort. Instead, I was struck with the news of my brother's perilous situation. I learned that he was currently at SickKids hospital receiving the first round of chemo, and that it would likely be a stronger dose than he'd ever taken before. Painful memories of pulling out hair, empty bedrooms, and silent car rides home returned to me all at once. These memories quickly melted into frustration and denial. I recall asking about the survival rate again and again as if my dad was withholding an answer, and eventually realizing that he now had no more information than I did. We were both in the same position, unable to do anything but observe my brother's struggle to survive.<br><br>

It has now been almost two months since the first round of treatment, and things have just took a turn for the worse. Without going into much detail, Aaron's condition has been rapidly deteriorating as a result of complications following his treatment. I have not spent much time at the hospital, but have heard heartbreaking stories about his ordeal and the unbearable pain he is experiencing. I have not been video calling him often, and when I do, he is often sleeping or in a weary state. I am not doing all that I could to help Aaron through this time and I hate myself for this. Some part of me trusts that my parents have the situation locked down, and that there's nothing I can possibly contribute to make a difference. I cannot help, though, but feel guilty about missing potentially some of the final moments I will have with him. For the last twelve years, Aaron has been such a constant presence in my life. We've shared laughter, fought fiercely, and done everything else in between. We started playing chess together, shot hoops late into summer evenings, and biked to the corners of our small suburban slice of earth. My brother has been the single greatest influence and inspiration for me, and I'm not certain what a future without him would look like. As the older brother, I am duty-bound to protect Aaron from any harm that comes his way. The least I can do is be there for him as support while he is suffering during these trying times. <br><br>

I will visit the hospital tomorrow. And the day after, and after that, and everyday thereafter until school begins.
