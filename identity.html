                At age 17, I came across an interesting piece on the butterfly effect. It covered the science behind chaos theory and how small, ordinary events could have profound impacts in the grand scheme of things. I'd considered this fact before, yet it shook me all the same when I realized its implications on my own life. Every hour I'd previously invested into school and extracurriculars was exactly this: an investment. A cheque issued with expectation of return, hopefully in the form of a financially secure and meaningful future. I failed to consider every unexpected "butterfly" that could affect the outcome of my pursuit.<br><br>

Consequently, I made a promise to myself that I would live a life on my own terms. For the better part of a year, I worked on improving my physical health, mental wellbeing, and interpersonal connections. I developed new extracurricular interests, established my ethnic identity, grew a friend circle, and rediscovered an inclination for innovation. I was able to not only experience personal growth, but also prepare myself for the challenges that await me in adulthood.<br><br>

Now, at age 18, I have no more control over my future than I did before. I have, however, adopted a holistic approach to everything that I do. I'm an avid cyclist, game designer, chess competitor, tech nerd, and cyclical caffeine addict. I listen to brooding indie songs while coding hobby projects and read Stoic literature in my spare time. While I once defined myself with my resume, I've come to realize that the pursuit of self-realization is just as meaningful as high achievement. Just as the flap of a butterfly's wing can set off a storm, the seemingly insignificant aspects of my identity will decide my future in the end.
