                    <p>I'm 18 years old, and currently studying Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo. I aspire to work at the forefront of AI technology to design systems that empower those in need. I believe that advancements in artificial intelligence will be the key to unshackling billions from the poverty trap. Beyond mere career ambitions, I wish to pursue a future in which economic insecurity is only a choice, and all individuals receive adequate opportunities to thrive. <br></p>
