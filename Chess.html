                I got into chess seriously after finishing the Netflix series 'The Queen's Gambit', in November 2020. When I first started playing, I lost countless times to more experienced players. I realized through these many failures that the outcome of each game can only be attributed to the victor's skill and determination. When one loses ELO points, they must admit that their opponent outplayed them. There are no excuses in chess, only winners and losers. I felt drawn in by the humbling and absolute nature of this game, and pursued the path of improvement despite the inevitable losses. <br><br>Over the ensuing months, I worked tirelessly to advance my abilities. In return for my efforts, I observed remarkable progress in a short span of time. My rating jumped to over 2000 within eight months, and soon I was beating opponents with decades of experience more than I. Chess has become an integral part of my identity and changed the way I approach the challenges of life. I no longer fear failure. Instead, I welcome it as a necessary prerequisite to success. I am constantly improving at the game of chess, and intend on securing an official title in the future.

                <h1>Improvement Log</h1>
                <h2>[2023-05-29]: Hit 2200 blitz on main account.</h2>
                <h2>[2023-05-25]: Blitz is steadily coming easier. Building strong chess intuition, rather than brute force calculation.</h2>
                <h2>[2023-05-12]: Honed blitz skills through anonymous games. I find this helps to relieve the fear of losing significantly, allowing me to play more freely. Blitz rating has correspondingly increased, and passed 2200 on alt account.</h2>
                <h2>[2023-04-01]: Huge progress in rapid. Not sure why, but I'm all of a sudden crushing high 2300s and 2400s with ease. Best moves are coming instinctively, faster and faster.</h2>
                <h2>[2023-03-05]: Going to stop grinding blitz. Not productive in terms of improvement, inferior to rapid.</h2>
                <h2>[2023-02-08]: Remember to play SOLID blitz. Play safe openings and maximize tactics.</h2>
                <h2>[2023-02-05]: Hit 2300.</h2>
                <h2>[2023-02-03]: Improvement in prevention of losing streaks. Patience and recovery time are essential.</h2>
                <h2>[2023-02-02]: Rapid rating has steadied, indicating real improvement. Work on time-per-move consistency and management of mental state.</h2>
                <h2>[2023-02-01]: Best moves coming more consistently. Achieving dominating positions and tactics grind is currently paying off.</h2>
                <h2>[2023-01-31]: Outplaying majority of opponents 2200-2250, some 2300s. Work on time management next.</h2>
                <h2>[2023-01-26]: During rapid games, remain aware of opponent's tactics at all times. Most games lost are due to growing complacent.</h2>
                <h2>[2023-01-18]: Crossed 2700 puzzle rating for the first time.</h2>
                <h2>[2023-01-15]: Analysis ability of complex positions has improved. Middle games are my strength by far.</h2>
                <h2>[2023-01-07]: After long puzzle grind, feeling quite underrated when playing blitz and rapid. Breaking 2300 rapid will require quite a bit of positional work.</h2>
                <h2>[2023-01-03]: Deploying impressive tactics in blitz, solving 2600 puzzles faster and with more confidence.</h2>
                <h2>[2023-01-02]: Feeling much sharper in both rapid and blitz today, puzzle grind appears to be paying off. Pay close attention to defining traits of win streak.</h2>
                <h2>[2023-01-01]: With black, stop creating semi-closed positions that allow white queen to target king, close the center as much as possible.</h2>
                <h2>[2022-12-30]: D4-B3 consistent blitz opening, optimal 3|0 playstyle is aggressive yet defensively solid.<br></h2>
                <h2>[2022-12-29]: During winning streak, actively maintain drive to win and approach each game carefully.<br></h2>
