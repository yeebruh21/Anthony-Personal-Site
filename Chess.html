                I got into chess seriously after finishing the Netflix series 'The Queen's Gambit', in November 2020. When I first started playing, I lost countless times to more experienced players. I realized through these many failures that the outcome of each game can only be attributed to the victor's skill and determination. When one loses ELO points, they must admit that their opponent outplayed them. There are no excuses in chess, only winners and losers. I felt drawn in to the humbling and absolute nature of this game, and pursued the path of improvement despite the inevitable losses. <br><br>Over the ensuing months, I worked tirelessly to advance my abilities. In return for my efforts, I observed remarkable progress in a short span of time. My rating jumped to over 2000 within eight months, and soon I was beating opponents with decades of experience more than I. Chess has become an integral part of my identity and changed the way I approach the challenges of life. I no longer fear failure. Instead, I welcome it as a necessary prerequisite to success. I am constantly improving at the game of chess, and intend on securing an official title in the future.
